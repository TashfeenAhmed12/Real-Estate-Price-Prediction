# Real Estate Price Prediction

# Project Description
 Create and train real estate price prediction model using sklearn and linear regression

Technologies used in this project- Python, Pandas and Numpy for data cleaning, Matplotlib for data visualization, Sklearn for model building and Jupyter notebook

Methodology
Steps

1. Data Ceaning: Dataset collected from Kaggle.com. Use the code to keep required columns, convert ranges to average, remove null values, remove outliers and solve dimesionality curse

2. Model Building: Use cleaned up dataset to build a machine learning model by using K-fold cross validation and GridSearchCV to create best algorythm and parameters

# Business Value
1. Accurate price predictions and better buying and selling decisions

2. Improve profit margin
